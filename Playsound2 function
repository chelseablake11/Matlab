%Function script for playsound command that will play the chords together




function playsound2(r,s)
% r = Pythagorean fifth ratios
% s = even tempered fifth ratios

%Choose a sampling rate fs, e.g. 8000 Hz. (You'll need a higher rate if 
%you want sounds above 4000 Hz).

 fs = 12000;
 
 %Generate time values from 0 to T seconds at the desired rate.
 
 T = 0.5; % 2 seconds duration
 t = 0:(1/fs):T;
 
 %Generate a sine wave of the desired frequency f at those times.
 
  f = 240;  %base frequency
  a = 0.07; %parameter 1
  b= 0.5;   %parameter 2

  
      x=b*sin(2*pi*r*f*t);  %Pythagorean tone
      w=b*sin(2*pi*s*f*t);  %even tempered tone
     sound(x+w, fs);        %plays the tones together
